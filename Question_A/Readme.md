# Overlap Checker

Check if 2 lines are overlapped.

## Usage

Run "python3 script_overlap.py"

You'll have to insert the 2 coordinates in the line1 (x1,x2) and in the line2 (x3,x4) in order to know if the lines are overlapped.

Run "python3 script_overlap.py -test"

Using "test" parameter you can test the program within specified range (star and stop point) and how many times (loops) you want.
