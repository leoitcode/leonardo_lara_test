# Overlap Checker

Check if 2 lines are overlapped.

## Usage


<pre><code>Run "python3 script_overlap.py"</code></pre>


You'll have to insert the 2 coordinates in the line1 (x1,x2) and in the line2 (x3,x4) in order to know if the lines are overlapped.

In this mode you can visualize a graph showing the possible overlap or the distance between the two lines.

<pre><code>Run "python3 script_overlap.py -test"</code></pre>


Using "test" parameter you can test the program within specified range (star and stop point) and how many times (loops) you want.,
